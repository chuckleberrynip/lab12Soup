## The Idea with this app was to make a list of ingredients to put into a soup.
### This is also the first time that I am with React, and it was weird how large the files were, and there is the possibility that some of the files did not properly upload. Especially unusual that all of the node modules failed to upload.
#### What's Working: 
* The input is being listed properly.
* The inputs are being stored into the array.
#### Major Feature Required: 
* Displaying what the user inputed into the text box.

#### Output of What's Working:
